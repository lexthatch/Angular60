#Current Arrests
This is a simple example of how we could consume third-party API's and make our own application

This is using Canyon County's API here

See if you can make it look better than the real thing here

This example uses Animation to go between views and it loads up the views so you will need to run
this app on a web server. The easiest would be `http-server` installed via `npm`
